# Bee Crazy Game Pass

This repository contains the Bee Crazy Project bot, similar to the Hamster Attack bot.

The data is saved in firebase db, and obtained for validation as soon as the user enters the website or saved as soon as he closes the tab.

When starting the server, it will be necessary to pass two parameters in the URL, with uid being the "uid" of the Telegram account and "nameTelegram" being the name of the Telegram account. Ex: http://localhost:4173/?uid=teste-uid&nameTelegram=nome_teste

Start the server and then the bot, don't forget to obtain this data from the bot server and mirror the game server with the user data.
